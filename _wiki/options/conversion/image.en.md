  *  Split data by rows;
  *  Data block size:
      *  8 bits;
      *  16 bits;
      *  24 bits;
      *  32 bits;
      *  theoretically, it can be expanded up to 64 bits, but the work will be very uncomfortable;
  *  RLE compression;
  *  Bytes order, Little-Endian or Big-Endian;
  *  Trailing bits - bits in the data blocks what are not related to the original image;
